Gaffe handles Rails error pages in a clean, simple way. The default error page looks like this:

You should overwrite it though, it’s very easy to do so.

## Installation

Add this line to your application’s Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'gaffe'
```

## Usage

The easiest way to use Gaffe is with an initializer:

```ruby
# config/initializers/gaffe.rb
Gaffe.enable!
```

### Custom controller

However, if you want to use your own controller:

```ruby
# config/initializers/gaffe.rb
Gaffe.configure do |config|
  config.errors_controller = ErrorsController
end

Gaffe.enable!
```

It’s also possible to use a custom controller based on the URL in which the error has occured. This is especially
useful if you have an application that also serves API requests via JSON. You would probably want to serve API errors
through JSON and regular errors through HTML pages.

```ruby
# config/initializers/gaffe.rb
Gaffe.configure do |config|
  config.errors_controller = {
    %r[^/api/] => Api::ErrorsController,
    %r[^/] => ErrorsController
  }
end

Gaffe.enable!
```

The only required thing to do in your custom controller is to include the `Gaffe::Errors` module.

Only `show` will be called so you might want to overwrite it. You might also want to get rid of filters and other stuff.

```ruby
class ErrorsController < ApplicationController
  include Gaffe::Errors
  skip_before_filter :ensure_current_user

  def show
    # The following variables are available:
    @exception # The encountered exception (Eg. `#<ActiveRecord::NotFound …>`)
    @status_code # The status code we should return (Eg. `404`)
    @rescue_response # The "standard" name for the status code (Eg. `:not_found`)
  end
end
```

### Custom views

You can (and should!) also use your own views. You just have to create a layout:

```erb
<!-- app/views/layouts/error.html.erb -->
<h1>Error!</h1>
<%= yield %>
```

And create a different view for [each possible error rescue response](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/f9ceefd3b9c3cea2460a89799156f2c532c4491c/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/middleware/exception_wrapper.rb). For example, for `404` errors:

```erb
<!-- app/views/errors/not_found.html.erb -->
<p>This page does not exist.</p>
```

### Custom exceptions

If your application is raising custom exceptions (through gems or your code)
and you want to render specific views when it happens, you can map them to
specific rescue responses.

```ruby
# config/application.rb
config.action_dispatch.rescue_responses.merge!('CanCan::AccessDenied' => :forbidden)
config.action_dispatch.rescue_responses.merge!('MyCustomException' => :not_acceptable)
```
